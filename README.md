## A quick start

- [Installation guide](docs/install.md)
- Examples in [aern2-real README](aern2-real/README.md)

## Libraries

- [aern2-mp](aern2-mp):
  Multiple-precision interval arithmetic (fairly complete)

- [aern2-real](aern2-real):
  Cauchy real numbers (fairly complete)
- [aern2-fun](aern2-fun):
  Generic operations for real functions
- aern2-fun-univariate:
  Continuous real functions of one variable and their polynomial enclosures (currently broken, not built by default)
- *other packages* (currently broken)

## Executables

- aern2-fnreps:
  Benchmarks evaluating various representations of univariate continuous real functions (working version on branch [fnreps2020](https://github.com/michalkonecny/aern2/tree/fnreps2020/aern2-fnreps))

## Significant dependencies

- [collect-errors](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/collect-errors):
  Type wrapper `CN` for gracefully propagating numerical errors through expressions

- [mixed-types-num](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mixed-types-num):
  Bottom-up-typed numerical expressions

- [cdar-mBound](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cdar-mBound):
  Exact real arithmetic built on floating-point-like intervals based on Haskell `Integer`s.  AERN2 currently uses the types `Dyadic` and `Approx`.

## Other references

- [haskell-reals-comparison](https://github.com/michalkonecny/haskell-reals-comparison):
    Benchmark(s) comparing the performance of Haskell libraries for exact real computation (work in progress)
